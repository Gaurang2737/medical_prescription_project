# medical_prescription_project
This project is focused on extracting and processing medical data using Python. It aims to simplify the handling of medical records and facilitate data analysis and processing through automated extraction techniques.

pdf2image library to convert pdf document to a list of images

OpenCV for basics image processing to make image more clearer

Pytesseract library to extract text from an image

Regular expression to extract useful information from a text block
Two thresholding techniques in computer vision to overcome unclear image issues,

    1. Simple thresholding

    2. Adaptive thresholding
 I have written code using an opencv library to pre-process image using adaptive thresholding so that image becomes clear and text can be extracted more accurately    
 i have build a FastAPI server for our document extractor project. covers the following things,




1.Writing simple get routine in FastAPI

2.Testing it using a tool called Postman

3.Write post routine for document extraction

4.Test it using Postman

5.Add exception handling
